{-|
An implementation of bidirectional maps between values of two
key types. A 'Bimap' is essentially a bijection between subsets of
its two argument types.

Each element of the left-hand type is associated with an element
of the right-hand type, and vice-versa, such that the two mappings
are inverses. Deleting an element will cause its twin to be deleted,
and inserting a pair of elements will cause any overlapping bindings
to be deleted.

Most functions implicitly consider the left-hand type to be the
key, and the right-hand type to be the value.
Functions with an @R@ suffix reverse this convention, treating the
right-hand type as the key and the left-hand type as the value.
